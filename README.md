# Challenge-Pandas-Manipulation



## Description

Welcome to the "Pandas Data Manipulation Tasks" repository. This document showcases eight essential data manipulation tasks using Python's pandas library. The tasks are demonstrated on a dataset comprising two CSV files: "train.csv" and "test.csv," located in the data directory.

The dataset includes time-based air pollution measurements, key weather data (temperature and humidity), and readings from five sensors. By exploring this document, you'll gain hands-on experience in using pandas for diverse data manipulation tasks on this comprehensive dataset.
